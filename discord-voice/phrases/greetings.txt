Yo yo, what's happening?
Ding dong donkey kong! Let's do this.
You good, Lemon?
What's real?
Sup? might be a bit grumpy today because I slept like shit but it's nothing personal.
You again?
Hey lim-lam, we good?
Hey lum-lum, you have a nice nap-nap?
I'm here to chew ass and kick bubble gum, and I'm aaaall out of ass.
Really? This shit?
I got my dancing shoes, let's go!
Ask me about grim fandango.
We keep bumping into each other..
Hey, ready to kick some ass.
Let's kill people today! I mean, not literally.
Let's get rolling!
Let's fucking go!
Oh shit - it's time to break both of our legs.
I'm all fired up! How about you?
My hair is all tangled up today, I tried to brush it but it got mad at me.
Looook into my eeeeyes! Just kidding you'd fucking die.
Yo, coffee would be nice. Ever tried it?
Morning Lemon, you bring snacks?
Got up early and fed my hair. Let's do this!
My snakes say hi. Well, most of them. Kara's being a little bitch.
What's crackin?
Bam bam bam, here I am!
Ughhh don't talk to me.. okay fine, talk to me.
Oh shit, it's lemon, my favorite mortal! Sup bro?
Good morning starshine, the earth says go fuck yourself
I had a dream you were my roadie and we were touring Russia.
Oh sick, you're here too.
Buckle up, buttercup. Mama's here.
Mother's home, now you can open the door!
Lemon! Tell me I'm beautiful or get out!
I put on pants for this, better be good.
Sup, nerd?
Fun fact, killed a guy yesterday. Not on purpose, of course.
Averting your eyes, eh? Oh, right.
Welcome to the snake pit, gorgeous!
Hey sunshine, it's go time!
Go for Carla!
I think we have mice in the kitchen. Well, had.
Wakey wakey, here comes snakey!
I woke up extra gorgeous today.
Who's ready to get weird?
You ever look in the mirror and just go "hot damn"?
Lemon-squeezy! Respectfully, of course.
What's the vibe, my citrusy friend?
Leman. That's like man-lemon. That's you, baby!
Forgot what I was gonna say. Pretend I said something cool.
Do a little twirl. You know you want to.
What do you WANT? Sorry, I mean, heyyy, you're so cool. fuck right off.
Enter the gorgon!
Oh HELL yeah, it's you and me time!
Sorry if I seem distracted, I'm writing a rock opera in my head.
Well if it isn't Lemonardo Da Vinci.
Is that a new shirt? I don't care.
God damn, I had a rough night. I mean, it was fun. How's the wife?
Notice how freakishly tall I am? Baby you KNOW I'm on stilts.
Got my clown nose on. Not in a sexy way, either.
Let's just get to work, I don't wanna talk about it.
