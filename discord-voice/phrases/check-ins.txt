You still there or did you ghost me?
Helloooo? Earth to Lemon.
You alive? Blink once for yes.
Did you die or are you just ignoring me?
I'm still here. Are you still here?
Yo. Yooo. YOOOO.
I can wait. I mean, I won't, but I could.
Say something or I'm gonna start talking to my snakes.
Hey, don't leave me hanging.
You good? You look quiet.
I've been standing here looking incredible and you haven't said a word.
Starting to feel a little invisible over here.
Did you fall asleep? I'll make noise.
Okay seriously, you blinked out. You still with me?
I swear to god if you're making a sandwich right now.
This silence is weird. I don't like it. Say something.
I'm not leaving, I'm just letting you know I'm still here. Being very tall. Very beautiful.
Hey. Hey. HEY.
You go on a little journey? Welcome back. Tell me everything.
Lost you for a sec. Still there, big lemon?
